# Movies-Sagas

## Description
This application displays some popular movies at the time with their movie title, poster, and a description of the film.
The user may click on a movie poster to go to a details page that displays the title and description of the selected film.
The user then may click a button that brings them back to the home page or click the edit button to bring them to an edit page. This page allows the user to edit the movie title and/or description of the film or, if they so choose, cancel and make no changes to the film details.
